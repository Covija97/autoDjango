# autoDjango

> **Batch file** that automatically generates the structure described in [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/django/) to create Django projects

## [createdjango.bat](/src/createdjango.bat)

### **Usage**

1. Download the file [createdjango.bat](/src/createdjango.bat).
2. Place it in the root directory of your Django project.
3. Double-click on `createdjango.bat`.

### **Structure**

The `createdjango.bat` script automates the setup of a Django project environment. It performs the following tasks:

1. **Check Python version**: Verifies if Python is installed on the system.
2. **Check pip version**: Ensures that pip, the Python package installer, is available.
3. **Create virtual environment**: Prompts the user to enter a name for the virtual environment and creates it if it doesn't exist.
4. **Activate virtual environment**: Activates the specified virtual environment.
5. **Upgrade pip**: Upgrades pip to the latest version within the virtual environment.
6. **Install Django**: Installs Django using pip.
7. **Request Django project name**: Prompts the user to enter a name for the new Django project, ensuring it is valid and not already in use.
8. **Create Django project**: Uses `django-admin` to create a new Django project with the specified name.
9. **Verify project creation**: Checks if the project was created successfully and provides feedback.
10. **Create module installation script**: Generates a batch file (`install_modules.bat`) to install additional Python modules within the virtual environment.
11. **Create run script**: Generates a batch file (`run_<project_name>.bat`) to easily start the Django development server for the new project.
12. **Create applications script**: Generates a batch file (`apps_<project_name>.bat`) to create new Django applications within the project.

This script simplifies the initial setup process for Django projects, ensuring that all necessary components are installed and configured correctly.
